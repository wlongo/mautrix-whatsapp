Monkey Patch Details:

1. The mautrix-go project was embedded in the mod folder and has it's own git structure there 
2. The only file that was changed so far in the mautrix-whatsapp project was the go.mod file to allow the replacement 

* Important *

- mautrix-go would need to be upstream merged from time to time to avoid disruptures !
